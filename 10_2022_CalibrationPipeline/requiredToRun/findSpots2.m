% frame: Input image, a single frame from a recorded sequence.

% method: two different methods, either 1 or 2.

% gaussian: a switch which runs a guassian filter if set to 1
%
% disk radius in pixels for top hat transformation, quite critical to the method for finding candidate bright spots.

% output=1 to see figures and advance manually
